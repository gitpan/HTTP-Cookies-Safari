	* Cleanups for the move from CVS to SVN, kwalitee
	* Now requires Perl 5.006
	* No need to upgrade

1.12 - Tue Jan  9 23:02:48 2007
	* updated copyright and license info

	* Fixed issue with ignore_discard: cookies with no expiry were discarded
	anyway.

1.09 - Thu Oct 13 15:19:42 2005
	* Jon Orwants pointed out that a Safari cookie file could have a 
	date past the unix epoch for the expiry time of the cookie. I need to
	convert that to unix seconds internally. To get around this, dates too
	far in the future get truncated to 0xFF_FF_FF_FF.
	* If you are working with dates those far out, first ask yourself "Why?",
	then upgrade.

1.07 - Fri Mar 11 23:56:00 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* no code updates: no need to upgrade

1.06 - Mon Sep 20 20:13:09 2004
* updated to work with the latest Mac::PropertyList, which has a new
interface

1.03 - Thu Nov 27 06:56:07 2003
HTTP::Cookies::Safari now uses Date::Calc instead of Date::Manip.
This should make date calculations much faster. 

No bugs were fixed, but this should be a performance boost.

1.02 - Wed Jan  8 01:11:51 2003
	* now handles expiry times

1.01 - Tue Jan  7 23:54:19 2003
