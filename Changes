1.06 - Mon Sep 20 20:13:09 2004
* updated to work with the latest Mac::PropertyList, which has a new
interface

1.03 - Thu Nov 27 06:56:07 2003
HTTP::Cookies::Safari now uses Date::Calc instead of Date::Manip.
This should make date calculations much faster. 

No bugs were fixed, but this should be a performance boost.

1.02 - Wed Jan  8 01:11:51 2003
	* now handles expiry times

1.01 - Tue Jan  7 23:54:19 2003
	* initial version to work with Safari cookie files
